h1. About

This is simple and flexible deployment solution based on Git post-receive hook.

* You don't have to install anything on your server
* It works with whichever thinkable solution, Rails, Merb, "Rango":http://github.com/botanicus/rango, Sinatra or even Django or static pages, it just doesn't matter!
* Deployment to more servers is supported.

h1. Usage

# Run @gem install git-deployer --development@
# Add following lines to your file with "Nake":http://github.com/botanicus/nake tasks (I'll refer this file as @tasks.rb@):
<pre>
begin
  load "git-deployer.nake"
  Task["deployer:setup"].config[:user] = "root"
  Task["deployer:setup"].config[:host] = "tagadab"
  Task["deployer:setup"].config[:path] = "/var/www/deploy-test"
rescue LoadError
  warn "You have to install git-deployer gem if you want to deploy to remote servers!"
end
</pre>
# Install hooks via @./tasks.rb deployer:install@
# Edit @hooks/clone@ and @hooks/update@
# Install post-receive hook and create necessary directories via @./tasks.rb deployer:install@
# Push your changes via @git push origin master@

That's it. When you run @git push origin master@ for the first time, it should found that given branch isn't cloned yet, so it should

h1. Customization

It was pretty easy, was it? But what if I want ...

h2. Deployment to More Servers

@git push server1 master && git push server1 master@

h2. Restricting Just for @deploy@ Branch

You might not want to deploy every branch you push to origin.

h1. FAQ

# I had typo in my hooks, so it failed during deploy, how can I rerun it?

@./tasks.rb deployer:run@

# You are using "Nake":http://github.com/botanicus/nake, but everyone's using Rake. Is there any chance that you will support Rake in future?

The trouble with Rake is that Rake doesn't support configuration and it also really suck in command-line parsing. If Rake will support at least the command line arguments in a reasonable way, I can think about it.
