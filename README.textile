h1. Post receive hook

- reads /etc/profile
This hook runs after git push on your remote server. It supposed there is project/repo. When you first run push on this repo, the code is cloned into project/[branch] is created, and here some necessary files and directories are created. Then vhost file in projectdir/vhost/[branch].vhost is generated (it needs vhost-gen from git-deploy or your own hook
After the whole hook run application is restarted by touch tmp/restart.txt (which is Phussion Passenger way how to restart an application).

h1. Dependencies

- Git (of course)
- Apache
- Phusion Passenger (I'm using it for running Rails, Merb & Django, but it will be easy to work without it)
- http://github.com/botanicus/git-deploy

h1. File hierarchy

<pre>
project_type/project/repo.git
project_type/project/vhosts/[branch].vhost

project_type/support/hooks/update
project_type/support/tools/vhost-gen
</pre>

h1. Hooks

h2. Clone hook

This hook is run when project sources aren't cloned to [branch] directory yet. It creates log for apache logs and tmp for tmp/restart.txt.

h2. Update hook

Firstly, changed files are reset to avoid problems during rebase. Then rebase is run and last step is update hook. You can have local hook in support/hooks/update in your app or global hook in project/../support/hooks/update. Just first found is executed.

The hook runs after each sources update, even after first clone. It is great place to run your migrations, loading fixtures etc.
system vs. app update hook (just first)

h2. Vhost generation

If vhost for current branch doesn't exist, it is created. After vhost generation Apache is restarted.

h1. Server.thor

This file contains most common server tasks, restarting apache, running project.sh, http-probe.rb etc.

<pre>
