# === Documentation === #
# This hook run when a new branch is pushed. It's just a standard
# executable script, feel free to use ruby, python, shell or whatever.

# Just don't forget that gems you have on your local machine probably
# aren't installed at the server, at least before you run gem bundle.

# Your working directory is root of your application which was just cloned
# here. (Probably) unlike to your local machine, basename is name of the branch,
# not name of the application. It shouldn't matter in most cases, but sometimes
# it does, for example in Python where you are using import myapp.something.
# 1) Write an awful perl-ish script with sed -i / perl -i / ruby -i and just replace
#    the name in your code. It might work, but come on, you don't want to do that.
# 2) Your application will be as a subdirectory of the root of the repository,
#    so you may call it whatever you want.
# 3) Obviously the best solution is to change the post-receive script, for example:
#    Task["deployer:compile_hook"].config[:target] = "myappname"

# Make sure this script is executable, otherwise the script will be just
# loaded from post-receive hook, which means your shebang will be ignored.
# However this is useful when you want to use functions defined in the hook.
# If you want to install hooks which will be loaded rather than just
# executed, use ./tasks.rb deployer:install --no-executable or add
# Task["deployer:install"].config[:executable] = false to your tasks.rb

# Ruby on Rails
export RAILS_ENV="stagging" # if you are deploying to more servers, you might want to setup this in your /etc/profile
echo "Please edit config/database.yml and rerun this hook via ./tasks.rb deployer:run if you need so"
test -f config/database.yml.sample && cp config/database.yml.sample config/database.yml
rake db:create
exec "hooks/update"

# Rango
export RACK_ENV="stagging" # if you are deploying to more servers, you might want to setup this in your /etc/profile
echo "Please edit environments.rb and rerun this hook via ./tasks.rb deployer:run if you need so"
test -f environments_sample.rb && cp environments_sample.rb environments.rb
exec "hooks/update"

# Django
echo "Please edit settings_local.py and rerun this hook via ./tasks.rb deployer:run if you need so"
test -f settings_local_sample.py && cp settings_local_sample.py settings_local.py

# === Hints === #
# If each branch means a subdomain, you can generate vhosts in this
# hook. If you do so, then don't forget to restart your server!
# git push origin alpha  => alpha.example.com
# git push origin beta   => beta.example.com
# git push origin master => example.com

echo "Don't forget to edit hooks/clone\!"
